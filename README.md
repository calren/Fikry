# Fikry

This is an app that uses the [Google ML Kit API](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) to scan a book's ISBN
and then query for the book's ratings using the [Goodreads](www.goodreads.com) API.  

This app is heavily based on this [existing sample](https://github.com/firebase/mlkit-material-android) that 
showcases how to use ML Kit APIs with Material Design.
